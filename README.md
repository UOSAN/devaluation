# devaluation

The goal of **devaluation** is to facilitate the process of accessing
raw data from the [Healthy Eating
Study](https://ctn.uoregon.edu/projects/healthy-eating-study), conducted
by the [Social and Affective Neuroscience
Lab](https://sanlab.uoregon.edu/) at the University of Oregon. The
package name is inspired by the formal title of this study, *Devaluing
energy-dense foods for cancer control*. More information about the
studyâ€™s design, aims and measures can be found on
[ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03557710).
